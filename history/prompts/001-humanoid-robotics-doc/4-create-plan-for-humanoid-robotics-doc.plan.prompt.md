## Prompt

"Please continue"

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the implementation plan for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Documentation" project.

- **Plan File Created**: `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-doc/plan.md`
- **Research File Created**: `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-doc/research.md`
- **Data Model File Created**: `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-doc/data-model.md`
- **Agent Context Updated**: `GEMINI.md`
- **PHR Created**: A Prompt History Record has been created for this transaction.

The planning phase is now complete. The next step is to create the tasks for the implementation.
