## Prompt

"Please continue"

## Response snapshot

I have performed a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` for the feature `001-humanoid-robotics-doc`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Provided a detailed analysis report with identified ambiguities and underspecifications.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A (read-only operation)
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can choose to address the identified issues or proceed with implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: The analysis highlighted areas for improvement in the documentation's requirements and task coverage, particularly regarding edge case handling and the clarity of certain constraints.
