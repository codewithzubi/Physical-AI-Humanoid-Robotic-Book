## Prompt

"Please continue"

## Response snapshot

I have completed all the automated writing tasks for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Documentation" project, covering User Stories 1 and 2.

- **Tasks Completed**: T001 to T024 have been completed.
- **Files Modified**: `docs/intro.md`, `docs/fundamentals/ros2.md`, `docs/fundamentals/simulation.md`, `docs/advanced/perception.md`, `docs/advanced/reinforcement-learning.md`, `docs/capstone.md`, and `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-doc/tasks.md`.

The project is now ready for the manual "Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns" tasks (T025-T029).
