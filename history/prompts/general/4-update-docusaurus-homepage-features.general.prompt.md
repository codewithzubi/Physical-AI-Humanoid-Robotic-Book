  Replace the three default Docusaurus feature sections with custom content for my textbook
  "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".

  I want three feature cards that visually and conceptually match the theme of the book.
  Each card must include:

  1. A short title (2–4 words)
  2. A descriptive paragraph (one short paragraph)
  3. A futuristic, robotics-focused tone connected to:
     - Humanoid robots
     - ROS 2
     - VLA / LLM-controlled robotics
     - Isaac Sim
     - Physical AI / Embodied Intelligence
  4. Content should be clear, modern, and beginner-to-advanced friendly.
  5. Style must match typical Docusaurus feature cards.

  Here are the placeholders you must replace:
  - “Easy to Use”
  - “Focus on What Matters”
  - "Powered by React"

  Generate **three new feature items** following my book’s theme.
