  replace the whole landing page color with attractive colors and picture related to book content
response_text: |
  I have successfully updated the `docs/src/pages/index.module.css` file to include the new background color, background image, and text color for the hero banner. I also created a placeholder image `docs/static/img/hero-background.png`. The user should replace this placeholder with an actual book-related image for the best results.
