# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics - From Digital Brain to Embodied Intelligence

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
All technical explanations, concepts, and instructions must be precise and validated against current robotics and AI research.

### II. Clarity
Content must be accessible to intermediate to advanced learners in AI and robotics, with clear language and examples.

### III. Practicality
Focus on hands-on skills including ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Unity, and conversational AI integration.

### IV. Reproducibility
All tutorials, code snippets, and examples should be fully reproducible by readers using recommended hardware and software.

### V. Rigor
Preference for referencing peer-reviewed robotics, AI papers, and official documentation from NVIDIA, ROS, and related communities.

## Key Standards

- **Citations**: Use APA format for all references to research papers, manuals, and technical specs.
- **Source types**: Minimum 60% from peer-reviewed journals, official documentation, and reputable robotics/AI sources.
- **Originality**: Content must be original with zero plagiarism tolerance.
- **Writing style**: Technical yet approachable, suitable for learners with some AI and robotics background.
- **Format**: Markdown format compatible with Spec-Kit-Plus and Docusaurus, including clear section headings and bullet points.

## Constraints

- **Word count**: Approx. 40,000 words total across all modules.
- **Visuals**: Include diagrams, flowcharts, and code examples where relevant.
- **Code examples**: All code must be compatible with ROS 2 Humble/Iron, Python 3.x, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim APIs.
- **Hardware specs**: Clearly specify required hardware and software environments.
- **Accessibility**: Content should be optimized for both online reading and PDF export.

## Success Criteria

- Readers can fully simulate and control humanoid robots using provided instructions and code.
- Learners demonstrate clear understanding of embodied AI concepts and practical robotics integration.
- The book supports a complete learning journey from theory to capstone project with measurable outcomes.
- Positive feedback from target audience (AI practitioners, robotics students) in pilot testing.

## Governance
This constitution serves as the foundational blueprint for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" documentation project. All content, examples, and project structures must align with the principles and scope defined herein. Amendments to this constitution require a formal proposal and review to ensure the project's goals remain coherent and achievable.

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-07 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-07
