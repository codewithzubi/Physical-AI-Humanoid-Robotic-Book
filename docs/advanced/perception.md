# Chapter 4.1: Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a powerful, scalable robotics simulation platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse. It offers high-fidelity, physically accurate simulation for developing, testing, and deploying AI-powered robots. Isaac Sim is particularly well-suited for training reinforcement learning models and testing complex multi-robot systems due to its GPU-accelerated capabilities.

In this chapter, you will be introduced to NVIDIA Isaac Sim, exploring its key features and how it integrates with other NVIDIA tools and the ROS ecosystem. We will cover:
- Overview of the NVIDIA Omniverse platform and its role in robotics simulation.
- Setting up your Isaac Sim environment and navigating its interface.
- Importing robot models and assets into Isaac Sim.
- Understanding the core components for physics simulation and rendering.
- Introduction to Isaac Gym for large-scale reinforcement learning.

## Chapter 4.2: Creating a Humanoid Robot in Isaac Sim

Building and configuring a humanoid robot within a simulation environment is a critical step for developing and testing complex AI behaviors. NVIDIA Isaac Sim provides a rich set of tools and assets for easily creating and customizing robotic systems, including advanced humanoid models.

In this chapter, you will learn how to set up and configure your own humanoid robot in Isaac Sim. We will cover:
- Importing pre-built humanoid robot models from the Isaac Sim asset library.
- Customizing robot properties, including joints, sensors, and actuators.
- Attaching sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs to your humanoid.
- Configuring the physics properties of your robot for realistic simulation.
- Basic control of the humanoid robot within the Isaac Sim environment.
