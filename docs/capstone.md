# Chapter 7.1: Project Overview and Setup

The capstone project is the culmination of your journey through Physical AI and humanoid robotics. In this project, you will integrate the knowledge and skills acquired throughout this book to build a simulated autonomous humanoid robot capable of performing complex tasks. This hands-on experience will solidify your understanding and prepare you for real-world robotics challenges.

In this chapter, we will outline the capstone project, define its objectives, and guide you through the initial setup steps. We will cover:
- Defining the scope and specific goals of the autonomous humanoid robot project.
- Setting up the integrated development environment, including ROS 2, Isaac Sim, and necessary AI frameworks.
- Reviewing the humanoid robot model and its capabilities within the simulation.
- Creating a project workspace and organizing your code for the capstone.
- A brief introduction to the overall architecture of the autonomous system you will build.

## Chapter 7.2: Implementing the Perception System

A robust perception system is fundamental for any autonomous robot to understand its environment, detect objects, and interpret sensory information. In this chapter of the capstone project, you will build the perception stack for your humanoid robot, integrating various sensors and AI models to create a comprehensive understanding of the simulated world.

We will guide you through:
- Integrating visual sensors (cameras) and processing image data.
- Implementing object detection and recognition using deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, EfficientDet).
- Utilizing depth sensors (LiDAR, RGB-D cameras) for 3D environment mapping and obstacle avoidance.
- Fusing data from multiple sensors to create a more accurate and robust environmental representation.
- Developing strategies for interpreting semantic information from the environment (e.g., identifying "graspable objects").

## Chapter 7.3: Implementing the Control System

The control system is the brain of your autonomous humanoid robot, translating high-level decisions from the AI and perception systems into low-level motor commands that execute physical actions. This chapter focuses on building a robust and responsive control architecture for your capstone project, ensuring your robot can move and interact effectively within its environment.

We will guide you through:
- Designing a hierarchical control architecture, from task planning to joint-level control.
- Implementing motion planning algorithms for navigation and manipulation tasks.
- Integrating inverse kinematics and dynamics for precise and stable movement.
- Developing reactive behaviors for obstacle avoidance and safe human-robot interaction.
- Utilizing ROS 2 control interfaces and controllers for hardware abstraction and real-time performance.

## Chapter 7.4: Final Project Demonstration

The final project demonstration is your opportunity to showcase the culmination of your efforts in building an autonomous humanoid robot. This chapter provides guidance on presenting your work, evaluating its performance, and reflecting on the challenges and successes encountered throughout the capstone project.

We will cover:
- Strategies for preparing and executing a compelling demonstration of your robot's capabilities.
- Metrics and methods for objectively evaluating the performance of your autonomous system.
- Troubleshooting common issues during demonstration and how to effectively present solutions.
- Documenting your project, including code, design decisions, and results.
- Future work and potential extensions for your humanoid robot project.
